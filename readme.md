<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
<p>This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game implementation. You can play with your friend or with AI. AI has 3 levels of difficulties:
    easy, normal and hard. On a hard level, it's impossible to win, as AI will always be able to make it at list a draw. If
    you win in hard mode do not hesitate to tell me how ;)

<h3>Computer Player or AI</h3>
<p>AI have been heavily inspired by
    <a href='https://mostafa-samir.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI/' target='_blank'>this page</a>. AI based on recursive minimax algorithm that scans all possible future boards and scores every possible
    move accordingly.</p>
<p>Also AI is a separate service which, after initialization, only needs current state of a board to make its next move. In this
    way one can easily implemnt this AI in their own project.
